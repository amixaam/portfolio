title: "Hey, I'm Roberts"
---

I’m a software engineer from Latvia, currently based in Prague, focused on
building polished web and mobile products that feel fast, clear, and reliable.

I started programming at 10 with **Scratch**, then moved through **Python**,
**C#**, **PHP**, **JavaScript**, and **Kotlin**. That broad stack experience helps me
move comfortably from product design to backend logic to frontend implementation.

Outside of engineering, I play piano and flute, and have performed in choirs and
orchestras. Music keeps my creative standards high and strongly shapes how I think
about rhythm, detail, and user experience.
