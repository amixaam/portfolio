Iâ€™m a passionate software engineer from Latvia, always eager to
learn. I play the piano and flute, and have contributed to
orchestral bands and choirs.

Programming has been my favorite activity since I was 10,
starting with **Scratch** and progressing to **Python**, **C#**, **PHP**,
**JavaScript**, and **Kotlin**. My relentless pursuit of excellence
drives my success.
